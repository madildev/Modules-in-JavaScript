Inventory System:

                 This is a inventory system in which the system takes the order placed by the customer and the compares them in the inventory of the store. If the user has
                 A gift Card for payemnt it adjust the price of the items. Then places a Shipping number and ship the order to user. 
                 The main focus of this program is on the "promise" in JS:
                           
                           
                           A "Promise" is object that is used to perfom the Asynchronous Operations. A promise always resolves a result either
                           "resolve" or "reject". In this program I created all the functions in "library.js" and imported them in the other file. In the "display.js" I called all the promises and linked them using Composition of the promise.
