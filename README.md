# Modules-in-Javascript

"Modules are the resuable pieces of code that can be imported or Exported from one file to another within the project. They are the latest feature of the JavaScript ES6".

They are very useful because: 

- They make the program easy to debug 
- They also help to maintain the privacy of the data between different modules.

## Methods

There are several methods for using the import/export modules in JavaScript: 

- The first is "module.exports" to export modules and "reqiure()" import modules.

- The Second is "default export" to export modules and "import from" to import modules 

- The Third is "export{properties}" to export and "import{properties} from " to import modules

- In "Airplane.zip": I used the third method to import/export modules. And I dispalyed the status of the Staff of Airplane.
