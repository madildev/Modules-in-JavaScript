Message Mixer: 
               It is a program that uses the JS modules to mix and match the message. Like changing the first letter of every word and encode the
message the by replacing the characters. The main focus is on the modules. I created all the functions in "messageMixer" file and then import the functions into the "message file" in order to display the result
